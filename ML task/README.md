### Task 3: 

    Aim: To create a neural network model of the highest accuracy, with the least number of parameters to classify Cat and Dog 
    
    
    process: 
             -Load the dataset from a given folder 
             -Does the preprocessing on input data
             -Create a Neural network model using Keras API
             -Validating model
             -Model Summary can be seen in jupyter notebbok 
             -It achieves around 84% accuracy
